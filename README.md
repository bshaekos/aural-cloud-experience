# Sonus

### Project Description 
Sonus is a sound-and-location based social network.

Recordings are posted in physical locations, to be later encountered by others when they visit those locations. As these posts accumulate in space, they form visible “clouds.” As with atmospheric clouds, these assume abstract but classifiable forms reflective of dynamic and emergent conditions––in this case, social rather than meteorological.

Fundamentally, this sound-and-space project intends to center accessibility for the visually impaired into its functionality, and culminates into cloud-like traces of spatialized auditory embodiment of place.
